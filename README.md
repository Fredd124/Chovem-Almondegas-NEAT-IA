# NEAT-GAME
An IA that plays a simple game I made, using the NEAT python module.

This project is inspired by the youtube video series "Python Flappy Bird AI Tutorial (with NEAT)" by the youtube channel "Tech With Tim".

# Instructions 
If you want to play the game by yourself, simply run the game.py file. 
If you want to watch the evolution of the AI playing the game, run the NEAT-game.py file. It's possible to load an AI genome previously trained. For further information on the subject, pleased read the comments on the code. 
You can also change the configuration of the Neural Network on the config-feedforward.txt file. If you wish to understand all the information on that file, feel free to read the NEAT documentation.
